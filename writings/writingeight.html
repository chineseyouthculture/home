            <h2>Bananas</h2>
            <h3>By: Jessica Zhang</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Wikipedia defines bananas as “an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.” I like to joke that I’m similar to the banana, not because I am descended from the genus Musa, but because I am yellow on the outside and white on the inside. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I’ve been questioned many times as to why I don’t know how to speak Mandarin. I say questioned, but it really feels more like an interrogation. “But you’re Chinese, why can’t you speak the language? Did your parents not teach you? Aren’t you ashamed you can’t communicate with your family? How does it feel being a disgraceful, uncultured disappointment?” Ok, the last part is a bit dramatic, but that’s more or less what it feels like I’m being asked. I get these questions from both Chinese and non-Chinese people, who for some reason believe it’s their responsibility to shame me for my lack of knowledge (as if I didn’t already do it to myself, constantly). I think oftentimes, people jump to conclusions when confronted with bananas such as myself. They assume that I am stupid, uncultured, and westernized--all of which are true at face value, but lack the important understanding of context.

                <br>
                I’ve only been to China two times in my life. The first time, I was five, the second time, twelve. These two instances total up to two months in China. The first time I went, I couldn’t speak the language then, but my extended family still had hope that I would learn it eventually (I never did). I remember my uncle letting me use his fancy Chinese calligraphy set, in hopes that he could teach me how to write Chinese characters. To his horror, when left alone, I would use all his paper and ink in drawing pictures of my cats back home. I didn’t quite like the traditional Chinese food there, and my mom tells me that I “survived on very little that month,” even refusing to eat rice. I was effectively mute the whole trip, but when I did speak, I spoke only to my close family in English. Even then, I felt out of place in China - I stuck out like a sore, western thumb. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When I went back most recently, I went in with the mindset of trying to learn more about my culture and getting a grasp of the language. I was hopeful and excited to meet my extended family, but that was shot down quite quickly. In fact, I can remember the exact moment when all the ambition I had dissipated. I was trying my best to speak the language, however I was butchering it quite terribly. I tried to ignore the laughs from my relatives, but my patience was wearing thin. It was a daily occurrence for me to attempt to speak in Chinese, and send the whole room booming with laughter. One day, I went out to dinner with the whole family, and my uncle who I had so much respect for, said to my cousin in Chinese, “Jessica can’t speak Chinese, do you think she is still a Chinese person?” My cousin replies that since I have Chinese blood that I am Chinese whether or not I can speak the language. My uncle scoffs, saying “Really? Because I think she’s a white girl.” I decided to stop trying to learn anything about my culture or language, because it seemed that when I tried to speak it, I was only being ridiculed and made fun of for it. I’ve been called White more times then I can count, but it was completely different hearing it from my uncle. I was humiliated, and had to pretend as if I didn’t hear what they said, which was easy, as everyone already had the assumption that since I didn’t speak Chinese that I was stupid. I was incredibly ashamed, and my relationship with extended family and Chinese culture deteriorated. I spent the majority of that month counting down the days before I could leave. I would text my friends at the dinner table, and when called out by my relatives, I would smile, nod, and completely ignore them. If I was going to be labelled the “stupid white girl”, I might as well play the part, right? 
                <br>
                <br>
                By the end of the trip, I was completely fed up with my extended family and wanted nothing to do with Chinese culture. I gave up trying to learn the language or better my relationship with my family. I felt so embarrassed for ever trying to learn, and even today I hold a lot of shame and guilt. My dad tells me “China is your home. Even though you're born in Canada, your blood is Chinese blood.” My definition of home is different from my dad’s. Canada is my home, since it’s where the people I truly love are. I might be related to my family in China, but as harsh as it sounds, they are not my family. I don’t view them as my relatives, as I could never imagine loving someone and making them feel so incredibly ashamed of themselves. I do hold resentment towards my extended family, and I feel that in a way, I’ve been trying to run away from my Chinese culture. I have so many negative associations with my culture, that I can’t foresee a future where I’ll ever have a relationship with my relatives. Everyday, I slowly come to terms with the fact that I’ll never be a truly cultured Chinese person. I’ve given up, and frankly I don't care. Why would I ever want to associate myself with people who think I’m nothing more than a stupid white girl?

                So to answer the questions I posed at the beginning for all the people who are so incredibly interested in my lack of culture (which has exactly 0 effects on their own personal lives) here is the sparknotes version:
                <br><br> 1. “But you’re Chinese, why can’t you speak the language?”
                <br>Linguistic ability is not determined by ethnicity. I was born and raised in Canada and spent very little time in China. I was shamed continually when I tried to speak Mandarin, and now, I don’t really care to learn it (I’ve got a lot on my plate, and frankly, learning a language just to speak to relatives I resent isn’t a top priority for me)
                <br><br> 2. “Did your parents not teach you?”
                <br>No, my parents did not teach me. They spoke mandarin at home, but my guess is that something about my brain isn’t really hardwired to pick up languages easily. We couldn’t take many trips to China since we are a working-class family, so apologies if I couldn’t be marinated in enough culture to suit your standards. 
                <br><br> 3. “Aren’t you ashamed you can’t communicate with your family?”
                <br>My immediate family can speak English fluently, apart from my Dad. I am ashamed that I can’t speak to him specifically. As for my extended family… I do not care. 
                <br><br>4. “How does it feel being a disgraceful, uncultured disappointment?”
                <br>It feels great! The unwarranted comments about my intelligence and character are my favourite part.
