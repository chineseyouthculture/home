            <h2>“Japanese Cherry Blossom”</h2>
            <h3>By: Jessica Zhang</h3>

            <p>
                In elementary school, I faced my fair share of garden-variety racist comments, simply for existing as a Chinese person. In second grade, a white boy in my class started calling me “Japanese Cherry Blossom” while imitating some asian accent and pulling his eyes back. On an almost daily basis, boys would come up to me and sing “Chinese - Japanese - Korean” while pulling back their eyes in different directions for each ethnicity. When a new Chinese student joined our class and couldn’t speak English, I was appointed as his translator by my white teacher who just assumed I could speak Mandarin. My translational duties consisted of the student asking me a question in Chinese, of which I could only understand about 70% of, and me desperately trying to piece together a response, with the help of hand gestures and frantically scribbled images. I would compare it to playing Charades, except the person acting out the word didn’t fully understand its meaning, and the person trying to guess the word could only shout out a response in a semi-foreign language to the actor. Simon and I were both deeply confused that year. My white friend recounted her interaction with asian workers at the nail salon, and reiterated many times how cheap the salon was, mimicking a thick asian accent to play the role of the worker. I’ve been called “chink” and “dog-eater” more times than I can count.

                I understand that kids at young ages are stupid, and say things they don’t understand to be hurtful or offensive. What angers me more is that most likely they will have learned racist stereotypes and slurs from their very much adult parents who would continue to perpetuate hate. At the time, it hurt to be teased for being Chinese, and I felt that the only solution was to prove myself as White in any way possible. I felt embarrassed of who I was, and since I wasn’t surrounded by many other Chinese kids, I felt alone and out of place. I used to have a babysitter in elementary school who also cared for many other kids my age in the neighbourhood. All of her kids were white, and everyone she babysat was white, with the exception of myself. I would go home after being babysat, feeling sick in a way that I couldn’t describe. My babysitter had a swing on her front porch that I would stay on for hours, alone, until my mom came to pick me up. I preferred being alone than being surrounded by people who didn’t look at all like me. I was simultaneously afraid of, and seeking validation and acceptance from white people.

                <br>
                So, I tried to westernise myself as much as possible. I stopped trying to speak mandarin at home and asked my dad to stop packing me Chinese food for lunch. I grew accustomed to eating plain white bread and cheese sandwiches daily, and soon, any remnants of mandarin that I could speak were long gone. I wanted to make White friends, and I laughed along with their jokes about small-eyed Asians and whatever dog-eating nonsense that they were saying. I wanted to feel included, even if I was the butt of their jokes that were copied from late night television or the latest Adam Sandler movie.

                Canadians love to boast about being a mosaic as opposed to the American melting pot, as if that makes us any better, as if deep-seeded racism still isn’t alive and well. Canada is a multicultural country, rich with different cultures and ethnicities, warm and welcoming to all, and any other bullshit that we love to spew. Now, I don’t hate Canada, in fact, I’d consider it my home. I just find it so incredibly ironic how we can feel superior to America when it comes to cultural inclusion as people are still blatantly racist and spoon-feeding their racist opinions and ideas to their children. I know what you might be thinking, “not all Canadians are racist!” and I agree. Maybe the area where I grew up just had a larger concentration of racist people, or maybe their children were just bad seeds, or whatever the hell you need to tell yourself to feel better about the state of anti-asian hate crimes in Canada.

                Saying that “not all Canadians are racist” is true, but ultimately, does nothing to address racism in Canada and only seeks to invalidate experiences faced by many like myself. Being called “japanese cherry blossom” is not something that deeply pains me today, in fact I laugh at it. A joke so stupid and seemingly harmless made by an uneducated white boy. Except it isn’t so harmless when we continue to normalise racist jokes and instil self-hatred into young asian children, causing them to run from their culture. It isn’t so harmless when eventually a joke devolves into deep racist ideology, causing some individuals to be so consumed by hatred that they spit, cough on and punch elderly asian men in the street. Anti-asian hate crimes peaked at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as Asians were being stereotyped as disease-carriers. The same “harmless” joke of asians eating dogs and being dirty were now being weaponized to defend and justify anti-asian acts of hatred and violence.

                It is unfair that I was bullied into running away from my culture, and ridiculed into hating myself. I was robbed of a language I could’ve spoken--of family, people and stories I could’ve understood. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is unfair that in this glorious, welcoming, loving country, people who look like me--who look like my parents, are being attacked, abused, and killed. It is unfair that I have to fear for my parents' lives. 
                <br>
                <br>
                So what’s the solution here? Teach kids not to be racist? By extension, their parents would also have to be trained to unlearn racist stereotypes, and anyone who's ever tried to confront an adult on their racist tendencies knows exactly how that scenario plays out: “What? I am not racist! It was just a joke, I don’t understand why everyone is so sensitive nowadays.” Do we teach Asian children to be stronger? Hell, maybe throw in another Marvel movie with an all Asian cast and that’ll do the trick for sure. Should we just accept that bullying and racist jokes are just another facet of life? I would really love to believe that we are moving towards better times, and that soon, no child will have to experience the same hatred that their parents did. At the very least, I can only hope that they will not live in fear of being attacked and killed, in this country of “true patriot love”.
