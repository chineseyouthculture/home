            <h2>"The Canadian Burden"</h2>
            <h3>By: Jessica Zhang</h3>

            <p>
                My dad was born in China and spent his life there until he met my mom, who dragged him to the states in hopes of finding and eventually living “the American dream”. Some denied visas and squandered dreams later, they settled on Toronto and had my older sister. My dad is the hardest working person I have ever known. While working multiple jobs trying to secure any income in the first couple of years in Canada, he worked as a Chinese takeout delivery man, and was almost robbed at both gunpoint and knifepoint. Instead of just giving up his wallet, when asked today, his response was this: “It was Mother’s day they rob me! I saved so much money and I cannot give up so easily.” His stubbornness both astonishes and scares the crap out of me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Another thing about my dad - he loved smoking. He started at 14 and didn’t quit up until a couple of years ago. He says smoking is the norm in China as if that’s supposed to make him impenetrable against lung cancer. Aside from smoking out of addiction, I think he really did it to remind him of the good ol’ days in China. There are grainy, discoloured photos of him in wide rimmed glasses, a full head of hair, smoking cigarettes and drinking beers with his friends around a poker table, wisps of smoke drifting in front of the camera. My dad says to me, “When you and Hanna are done growing up, I must go back to China. China is my home.” My dad loves China so much--the only content he consumes is Chinese broadcast television and political Chinese influencers. I am not fluent in Chinese, in fact I can barely string together a sentence. All I can do is understand others when they speak to me, and even this I struggle with.

                I like to think that my dad went looking for the “American dream” but instead got stuck with the “Canadian burden”. I’ve never felt deeply connected to my culture and didn’t ever have the drive or motivation to learn more about it. I know I’m a disappointment, partially because I’ve always felt ashamed of my lack of linguistic ability, but also because many have told me straight to my face. It’s a vicious cycle to get caught in - being so ashamed by your lack of knowledge you give up on learning, and then being shamed by those of your culture for not knowing enough, only driving you to run further away from any connection and cultural ties. I can’t lie and say it doesn’t hurt me when those around me laugh and ridicule my lack of understanding, but the only person’s opinion of me who I truly care about with respect to this issue is my dad’s.

                <br>
                My dad never laughed or mocked me for not knowing the language, in fact, he's always made it a big deal to never embarrass anyone for not being able to speak a language properly. I'm sure this has something to do with him feeling ashamed of his poor English skills in his first couple of years in Canada and the US, and never wanting me to feel the same way. My dad has never said he was disappointed in me, or tried to make me feel guilty and ashamed for my inability to speak mandarin - not that I didn’t already feel both of those emotions, constantly. He has always told me the opposite - that he was proud of me and everything else I’ve accomplished. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My relationship with my dad has always been distant, due to the existing language barrier. At this point, the last remaining bit of motivation I have to learn Mandarin is to be able to talk to my dad and fully understand his responses. I don’t care to learn more about my culture, or connect to people that I have no interest in communicating with, people who would’ve laughed at me before. I want to know my dad for more than the stories he tells or those that my mom recounts about him. I want to hear and understand fully what he says, his advice, and to truly know him. I believe that would change my impression of him greatly. The smell of cigarette smoke and the theme song of a particular Chinese radio station playing come to my mind immediately when I think of my dad. I want there to be so much more that I remember about him, and I know the only way I can do that is if I am able to communicate with him fluently.
