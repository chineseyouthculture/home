            <h2>Chinese Customs and Conventions VS Western Customs and Conventions</h2>
            <h3>By:Christina Fan</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Customs and conventions. You never really notice this, but as you get older and older, you get infiltrated by society’s invisible norms and unwritten rules, making you more worldly or “street-smart”. To be honest, this kind of understanding just naturally forms over time without you even realizing it’s taken place until it’s become a part of your life habits. As a Canadian-born Chinese, I remember when I was growing up I went through a process where I slowly began to realize that Western and Chinese cultures have different customs and conventions and that there’s a time and place to apply them. Obviously, these contrasts are caused by cultural differences. I keep blaming cultural differences for the gap between Chinese and Western societies but I’ve never really explained these “cultural differences” in depth. Culture isn’t an easy topic to explain, much less concisely and accurately describing the differences between two different cultures. My best analogy is that Chinese culture, whether the language, education, traditions, customs or conventions is very reserved and tends to be more tactful while Western culture is much more open and direct. They both have their merits and demerits; you tend to notice that Chinese culture emphasizes the productivity and results of an issue while Western culture prioritizes the process and experience. At the same time, you’ll definitely notice that the “Chinese” way of thinking or doing things can be very limiting or rigid while the “Western” way can lack structure or organization.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, if we’re strictly speaking about customs and conventions, I definitely think Chinese conventions think way more into things than Western conventions do, sometimes to the point where it’s annoying. I’ll give a few examples that stem from my personal experiences and observations:
                <br>
                <br>
                Firstly, Chinese people are SUPER sensitive about money and finances. I’m not even an adult yet but this convention is just that strong. You could go out to eat, be grabbing a drink, or go watch a movie together and that issue of “who pays” will always come up. It’s simple in Western culture, you and your group will split the bill, or if it’s among close friends, then someone will just pay for it. But in Chinese culture, everything just has to be so much more complicated. For some reason, AA is not an option and it always has to be one person who covers the entire cost. I know it’s a matter of politeness, but when you’re out in public, ready to go on with the day, it seems pretty trivial to make such a big deal out of this. I think the root of this is that Chinese people take gains and losses pretty seriously and don’t like to owe others, whether it’s money or favours. This isn’t only in Chinese culture, this convention is actually pretty common in Asian culture.

                Another difference in the convention between the Chinese and Westerners is how parents treat their children after they reach their age of majority. Western parents are kind of known to “kick their child out of the house” once they turn 18, letting them become self-supporting and begin figuring things out on their own. This stereotype is exaggerated in media and entertainment and obviously not all Western parents do this to their children, but it does exist and portrays an important part of Western culture: independence. On the other hand, Chinese parents tend to dote more on their children and are keen to support them financially, whether for education or buying a property later on. This comes with a price too, you’ll notice that Chinese parents tend to be a lot more controlling and involved in their children’s affairs, ranging from what kind of education or career they want their child to pursue to what kind of friends and romantic partners they believe their children should have. Whenever I think about this, I kind of subconsciously come up with a reason for this that involves another comparison between the two cultures: Chinese culture is all about unity and everyone fitting together to make one piece, while Western culture focuses on independence and finding your own place in the puzzle. Western culture is all about the freedom of choice and the mindset that how you live your life is really nobody’s business except your own. There’s also another situation too, where Chinese parents who’ve immigrated to a Western country kind of get “converted” or integrated into this Western society, so some of their behaviour is Western-influenced, but they still haven’t lost their Chinese culture enough to be totally Western either. That’s probably why there are so many Canadian-born Chinese young people who feel connected to both sides, but also feel neither here nor there at times. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, another custom I’ve noticed is that Chinese people and Western people are sensitive or concerned about different societal aspects. The best example is mental health. In recent years, Western society has been placing greater attention on mental health, whether in academic institutions, workplaces, or other facilities of society. The idea of seeking support for mental wellbeing is so greatly broadcasted just to build this overall societal phenomenon that encourages everyone to prioritize their mental health and be comfortable voicing it as well. Taking educational platforms as an example, schools are now full of messages that encourage anti-bullying, anti-racism, anti-homophobic, anti-sexist, and basically anti any discriminatory comments or behavior. Even jokes made about this are not treated lightly and anyone with some tact knows not to be careless with their actions on these issues lest they get into trouble. On the other hand, while Chinese society doesn’t stand up for discrimination either, there is significantly less of an effort made to promote these ideas than in Western society, and you can usually get away from making jokes or inappropriate remarks about these issues. There are certainly not as many social welfare programs made available as in Canada, for instance, and these issues are not usually advertised in public either. In Canada, we have Professional Activity Days in the Toronto District School Board aimed at staff to continuously support students’ learning and well-being. In China, there are parent-teacher meetings, hosted in one big group that encompasses the students of the class, their parents, the teachers, and the directors. These meetings are meant to promote student success and foster friendly relationships among classmates when in reality it provokes competition and pressure in such a big group.
                <br>
                <br>
                All in all, when I’m comparing and contrasting these two cultures, I would say Western societal customs make more sense in the modern settings we currently live in than Chinese ones, simply because they are straightforward and reasonable. There probably existed a time period when the Chinese conventions were compatible with the society’s needs and social norms,  and as these customs have been treated as traditions and passed on, we still practice many of them even now. But as we’re living in the 21st century, it’s important that we have the ability to judge and evaluate these practices according to real-world circumstances and know what kind of influences and effects they pose today.
