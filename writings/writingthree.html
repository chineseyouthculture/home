            <h2>Chinese Language VS English Language</h2>

                One of the most significant communication barriers is that of foreign languages. Having ideas and messages you’d like to convey but getting held back by a particular system of communication that you haven’t mastered is pretty frustrating. It’s like when you’re trying to remember the lyrics of a song that was on the tip of your tongue, only the lyrics are in a whole other language, so you’ll never know how to say them properly. Unsurprisingly, our current society relies heavily on translation whether for something as basic as deciphering your rental contract in a foreign country or to compare the linguistic differences between the languages. But it’s important to note that these translations are not perfect and often miss things out or misinterpret things. This isn’t always because of the translator’s lack of proficiency in the languages, but because the languages have such diverse cultures that when you try to express one in the form of another they clash with each other. When you try to translate one language into another, not only what’s being expressed is closely related to the culture of the language, but the way it’s being expressed is also at heart. That’s why translating between certain languages is considerably harder than translating between others; it’s because certain cultures are more similar as a lot of cultures are derived from other cultures. That said, the combination of Mandarin and English is arguably one of the hardest languages to translate.

                When you grow up in a Canadian region but are native to your home language, Mandarin, in this case, you can’t help but catch onto these differences and think about why these gaps exist. There is a common phenomenon observed in Canadian-born Chinese youth, which is that when they communicate with people who are fluent in both languages, most often their parents or those they’re comfortable communicating with, they often speak “Chinglish”, a mix of Chinese and English. Is this because we want to flex our ability to go back and forth between our languages? Or our language skills are so broken we don’t have the sufficient vocabulary to speak fully in one language? In reality, we’re experiencing the effects of having a bilingual or multilingual brain. Oftentimes, especially when speaking orally, you don’t have time to find the perfect word that translates in another language of what you’re trying to say, so you just end up having a cluster of vocabulary from both languages when you speak. But sometimes, when you take the time to think really hard about it, you’ll find that some words in Chinese just can’t be replaced by English words, and certain English phrases just don’t go over well in Chinese either. Even if you do end up finding the perfect or close to perfect substitute in the other language, chances are most likely you’ll never be able to just as casually say that phrase or word in the other language than in the context of the original because of the cultural differences.

                For example, yuán ​fèn (缘分). This noun roughly translates to “fate” or “destiny” when describing human relationships or interactions. Let’s say you coincidentally met a friend you haven’t seen in a while, you might casually drop in: “We have yuán ​fèn” to acknowledge the mysterious force that caused your lives to cross paths. The origin of this word goes back to the Buddhist belief that the fate of a person is determined by the karma in past lives, based on their deeds, relationships, etc. Whereas in English, there isn’t really an equivalent term to this Chinese noun and it would seem a little peculiar if you greeted a friend you haven’t seen in a long time with: “We have a connected fate!” The best word I can think of in this particular context would be “serendipity”, and even then, you wouldn’t say “How serendipitous!” in this situation, nor does it have a similar meaning because its denotation doesn’t relate to fate or destiny at all.

                Another instance of certain phrases not translating properly would be the English idiom “Break a leg”. This phrase is pretty common in everyday conversation in Canada and means “good luck”. Often, this phrase is used in theatre or stage performances before the performer goes up, it’s a wish of good luck to the performer. This idiom can be traced back to the Elizabethan language, which at the time meant to bow by bending at the knee. Since a successful actor would “break a leg” on stage and receive applause, the phrase symbolizes a wish for good luck. However, in Chinese, there isn’t a phrase that’s anything similar to this, and the most accurate translation would probably be literally wishing someone good luck, which obviously has a great difference from the original saying and the culture behind it that’s related to the performing arts during the Shakespearean time.

                With that being said, these are all observations made from the perspective of a Canadian-born Chinese student. I’ve had the opportunity to notice these differences as I’m studying and using both languages in my daily life, so I’ve always felt connected to both sides when I’m using the languages. Obviously, it’s impossible for me to be unbiased and evenly distributed on both sides, but I find that a lot of times, even when I’m talking casually with my friends or family, I need to resort to using both languages during my communication. I really appreciate being able to be literate in Chinese because it’s opened my eyes to the literary culture of China in terms of how they express their messages and how that’s different from Canadian literature. Sometimes, I would wish I could be born and raised in China so I could have an even deeper, and perhaps more authentic understanding of Chinese culture, but I realized that it’s because of my connection between the two cultures that I’m able to learn more and embrace the differences. My status as a Canadian-born Chinese student allows me to observe and apply the best of both languages or both cultures and come to appreciate the cultural diversity I’m witnessing and living in.
