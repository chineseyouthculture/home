                This project aims to provide a platform for Chinese-Canadian teenagers and young adults to share their feelings and experiences about Chinese culture in the context of Canadian society. 
                We hope to promote diversity and acceptance among Chinese-Canadian youth regarding Chinese culture and spread awareness about difficulties regarding Chinese cultural identity and integration in Canadian society. 
                We'd like to achieve this by posting original artwork and literature in Chinese to portray the differences in outlook on culture between Canadian-born Chinese youth and immigrants.
